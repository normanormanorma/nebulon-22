"Doom city is a half imaginary, half real place. It’s always where I am. At night, the drunk, the weird, the crazy people come out to the streets and do their business. I ’m just strolling among them with my camera and try to catch the moments that I see. The pictures are projections of my inner chaos and confusion. When the sun goes down, that is the time when doom city comes alive." Balázs Varga

... Pictures coming soon ...
