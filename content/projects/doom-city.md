Doom city is a half imaginary, half real place. It’s always where I am. At night, the drunk, the weird, the crazy people come out to the streets and do their business. I ’m just strolling among them with my camera and try to catch the moments that I see. The pictures are projections of my inner chaos and confusion. When the sun goes down, that is the time when doom city comes alive.

... Pictures coming soon ...
