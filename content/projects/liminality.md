In anthropology, liminality means the transitional phase
connecting/dividing two stages or spatial processes.
In this personal project I am looking back on my life up
to this point, and realize a multitude of dividing lines
standing out.
If we are looking at the periods marked by the terms
‘before’ and ‘after’, each unit appears to be transitional,
is something “in between”.
Most of us are at the end of a certain chapter in our lives -
a choice of ours, our age, a circumstance or a traumatic
event. We get to a phase in between the past that
is over and the future that is yet to come. This is the
liminal space.
The word comes from the latin word “limen” which
denotes the threshold value of an arbitrary point of entry
or beginning. Writer and theologist Richard Rohr
describes this particular space like this: “Where we
are betwixt and between the familiar and the completely
unknown. There alone is our old world left behind, while
we are not yet sure of the new existence.” So we don’t
live our ‘old lives’ anymore but at the same time, the new
hasn’t been formed yet. The obscurity and insecurity of
this intermediary space often triggers anxiety.
My last few years have been all about this transition.
The period of the pandemic, the end of it, and all the
traveling, foreign projects and jobs as a consequence
of it. All along I always knew that each two-week or
monthly period was only temporary. I felt that my well-
accustomed life was being turned upside down, almost
coming to an end, and that what had only started would
only last for a certain period of time.
In this project I attempted to capture the duality of
this feeling visually. The photos are often taken in
physically also liminal spaces, mostly suburban,
transitional places that do not really belong anywhere
and therefore to no one.

... photos coming soon ...
