All over the Netherlands, the so-called “community
gardens” (Volkstuin) are very popular. These are plots
of land, where individuals or families can grow fruits and
vegetables, flowers, herbs and trees. A piece of land,
usually in the outskirts of a city is divided into smaller
parts, (some of them as small as 5m2) and locals can rent
them on yearly basis for a symbolic amount of money.
In the 17th century when these gardens were established
they had more importance regarding livelihood,
nowadays they are mostly for recreational purposes.
Some people have to wait for years to get a piece of
land in one of these community gardens, which shows
it’s popularity. Most of these gardens operate also
as associations, meaning that gardeners are helping
each other, organize events and discuss growing
ideas and experiences.
First I became visually intrested in those gardens with
small decorated shacks, and later as I started to build
rapport with the gardeners, I decided to photograph
them too. What I quickly realized is that many different
nationalities (for example: Dutch, Moroccan, Turkish,
Indonesian, Polish, English, etc.) are getting along very
well as respectful communities, interconnected
by the love of cultivation.
Most of the gardeners use alternative, clean, pesticide
free methods. As one of them said: “These vegetables
are healthier and tastier than what you can find in most
stores”. With my pictures I would like to show an example
of how people deal with the challenges of living in
a modern city, in a way that is humane and accepting.
All pictures were taken in ‘s-Hertogenbosch.

... Pictures coming soon ...
