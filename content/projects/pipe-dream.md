_noun_

_1. a fanciful or impossible plan or hope_

_word origin:_

_alluding to dreams produced by smoking an opium pipe_

In this project my main interest lies in the exploration of the subconscious mind and dreams. Photography is a good tool for discovery, as with analogue cameras I don't see the result immediately. Whats makes the process difficult is the reality connected nature of the medium.

Pipe dream is a visual record of a 4 years period of my life. These days were happy, but also lonely in a sense. I met a lot of people, and went to interesting places looking for something, that I didn't even know what it is. Alcohol and drugs were also taking part in the story, which helps to think less, and get closer to the subconscious. The pictures aim to get in connection with the viewers mind in the deepest sense.
