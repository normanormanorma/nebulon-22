Pipe Dream is a noun

1. A fanciful or impossible plan or hope
2. Word origin: alluding to dreams produced by smoking an opium pipe.

In this project my main interest lies in the exploration
of the subconscious and dreams.
Photography is a good tool for discovery, as with an
analogue camera I can’t see the results immediately.
What makes the process difficult is the fact that the
medium (photography) is also embedded in reality.
Pipe Dream is a visual record of a 4-year period of my life.
These days were happy but also lonely in a sense.
I met a lot of people and went to interesting places
looking for something that I didn’t know exactly what.
Alcohol and drugs were also taking part in the story,
which help to think less and get closer to the
subconscious. The pictures aim to get in connection
with the viewers mind on the deepest levels.
While making the pictures I was trying not to limit myself
to a concept just shooting from the gut. When I was
editing the photos later, I wanted to choose the ones
which are the most timeless and connected to the
collective subconscious.
To understand reality is my pipe dream.
A 1/1 booklet was created for this project in 2019.
