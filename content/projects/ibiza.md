In October 2018 I spent two weeks in Ibiza, Spain, visiting
a friend. My intention was to capture “the party island”
in off season. It was interesting to see a place which mainly
focuses on tourism to be so empty and chilled.
I went all over the island and I saw closed restaurants, empty
beaches, and shops covered in protective plastics for the
winter. It all felt like being in a backstage of a theatre.
The inhabitants of the island were really enjoying these times
when they can just rest and prepare themselves for the
next season.
In spite of what the pictures show the island is beautiful and
its people are very welcoming.
For the presentation of the pictures I chose the postcard form

- postcards that probably nobody would send.
